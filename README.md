# Job_Market_Analysis_Toolkit

# Overview
The Job Analysis Toolkit is a powerful yet straightforward Python package designed to streamline the analysis of job market data and extract essential insights. This toolkit is ideal for job seekers, employers, and analysts seeking to understand current job market trends, skill demands, and salary expectations. By focusing on practicality and simplicity, the toolkit allows users to quickly gain valuable insights without complex machine learning or natural language processing.

# Modules
The Job Analysis Toolkit is structured into three distinct modules:

**1. Analysis Module**
The heart of the toolkit, offering various statistical and analytical operations. It provides detailed analyses concerning job requirements, salary trends, and sector-specific growth. Functions like average_salary(), median_salary(), and trending_sector() help assess financial aspects and industry trends.

**2. Company Insights Module**
Focused on company-related datasets, this module helps users understand different company dynamics such as company sizes, the industries they operate in, and their specialties. Functions like company_info(), trending_skill(), company_type(), company_size_distribution(), and location_type() offer a deeper dive into how companies align with job market trends and skill demands.

**3. Job Market Trends Module**
This module identifies emerging job roles and high-demand skills, analyzing job postings and associated skills. It uses functions such as popular_job() and high_paying_job() to highlight opportunities beneficial for job seekers and educational institutions aiming to align curricula with market needs.

# Usage
